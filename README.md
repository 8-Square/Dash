# Dash
A heavily inspired/personal take on Tomb of the Mask

There are **3 Levels to play**, after moving, you don't stop until you hit a wall and collide or hit a spike and get reset

The game was made in 6 hours as part of a "game jam"

### Controls
**WASD/ARROWS** - Movement Keys

**R** - Restart the level



## Credits
Tomb of the Mask - this game takes absolutely no credit in the mechanics/idea as the game is a "parody" on it


All textures and code are by 8-Square
